# RFQ Overview  
**Community-Based Organization Partnerships for HOMES & HEAR Customer Support**

---

## 1. Background

The **Home Energy Rebate (HER) programs** – **HOMES** (Home Efficiency Rebates) and **HEAR** (Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates) – are new federal rebate programs funded under the Inflation Reduction Act and administered in Oregon by the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) with program delivery by Energy Trust of Oregon (Energy Trust).

From the October 25 HOMES & HEAR session:

- **HOMES**
  - **Whole-home, energy model–based** retrofit rebates.
  - Available to **all income levels**, with **fund set-asides for low-income properties**.
  - Requires **20% or 35% modeled energy savings** using DOE-approved, BPI-2400 compliant tools (e.g., Snugg Pro, OptiMiser).

- **HEAR**
  - **Point-of-sale / prescriptive** rebates for **low- and moderate-income households only**.
  - Covers specific measures: heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, electric stoves, panel upgrades, wiring, insulation, air sealing, ventilation, etc.
  - Has **per-measure rebate caps** and a **$14,000 maximum per home**.

Both programs:

- Require **income verification** (no self-attestation).
- Require customers to work with **enrolled HOMES/HEAR trade allies** in a **closed network**.
- Use a **reservation system** with expiration timelines and require specific documentation (geo-tagged photos, invoices, energy model or assessment).
- Target **low- and moderate-income** customers, with specific funding set-asides for low-income households and multifamily housing.

High-level timeline from the slides:

- **Oct–Dec 2025:** Program design; outreach to trade allies & CBOs  
- **Jan–Mar 2026:** Enrollment kick-off  
- **April–June 2026:** Training & approval  
- **2026:** Program launch  

CBOs are being engaged now because they are central to **reaching income-qualified households, supporting documentation, and helping people navigate closed trade ally networks and multiple funding sources**.

## 2. Purpose of the RFQ

The **Request for Qualifications (RFQ)** to Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) is intended to:

- Identify CBOs that can **partner with Energy Trust** to deliver **customer-facing support** for HOMES and HEAR.
- Build a network of CBOs that:
  - Help **low- and moderate-income customers** understand and access the new rebates.
  - Support **intake, eligibility, and documentation** in ways that are safe and accessible.
  - Help households **combine HOMES/HEAR with other incentives** (Energy Trust offers, weatherization programs, local funds).
- Ensure communities who face **higher energy burdens** and **historic barriers** can benefit from these programs as they launch in 2026.

The RFQ is **not** for contractors to install measures; that is handled through the **closed trade ally networks (Installer, Home Energy Assessor, Energy Modeler)**.  
This RFQ is specifically focused on **community-facing outreach and navigation roles.**

---

## 3. Scope of Work for CBO Partners

CBOs selected through the RFQ will be asked to perform some or all of the following functions, depending on capacity and geography.

### 3.1 Outreach and Education

- Provide **culturally and linguistically appropriate** outreach about HOMES & HEAR in your communities.
- Explain in plain language:
  - What rebates are available.
  - Who qualifies (low / moderate income, renters vs homeowners, single-family vs multifamily).
  - That customers must use **enrolled trade allies** and complete required assessments.
- Participate in **local events, workshops, and small-group sessions** to build awareness before and after launch.

### 3.2 Intake and Eligibility Screening

- Help households **pre-screen for eligibility**, including:
  - Income category based on **Area Median Income (AMI)** and household size.
  - Basic **site eligibility** (location, utility, housing type).
- Support customers in gathering **income documentation** or demonstrating **categorical eligibility** (e.g., via participation in other programs) as allowed by program rules.
- Where appropriate, connect households to **other existing incentives** (e.g., utility rebates, weatherization, rental heat pump programs) when those better fit their situation or timing.

### 3.3 Navigation of Trade Ally Networks

Customers **must work with enrolled trade allies** in a **closed network** (Installer, Home Energy Assessor, Energy Modeler).

CBOs will be expected to:

- Help customers **find and connect** with enrolled trade allies in their area.
- Support **warm handoffs**, including sharing (with consent) relevant intake information so customers don’t have to repeat themselves.
- Help the customer understand what each actor does:
  - **Home Energy Assessor** – completes the home energy assessment (for HOMES).
  - **Energy Modeler** – completes the BPI-2400 compliant model for HOMES.
  - **Installer** – installs equipment and measures.

### 3.4 Documentation and Application Support

Both programs require specific documentation: **income verification, assessment/model outputs, geo-tagged photos, invoices, and incentive applications**.

CBOs may be asked to:

- Help customers **collect and organize** documentation needed for rebate reservations and reimbursements.
- Explain key program steps:
  - Income verification and site eligibility
  - Home energy assessment (where required)
  - Reservation issuance and expiration timelines
  - Post-installation documentation and **reimbursement timing** after complete submittal
- Provide light **case management** to track where a project is in the process and flag issues early.

### 3.5 Support for Fund Stacking

There are **multiple funding sources** available to help decrease costs for customers (HOMES, HEAR, Energy Trust incentives, local/state programs).

CBOs will play a key role in:

- Helping customers **combine HOMES/HEAR rebates with:**
  - Energy Trust incentives.
  - OHCS/ODOE weatherization or bill assistance programs.
  - Local programs (city/county funds, PCEF-type grants, philanthropic funds).
- Making sure customers **don’t lose access** to other programs by mis-sequencing work (e.g., doing health & safety or enabling work with other funds first).
- Using program training to understand **where HOMES/HEAR should be the “anchor” and where other funds should go first**.

### 3.6 Customer Support and Advocacy

CBOs can also be asked to:

- Provide **ongoing support** to customers who hit barriers (language, digital access, confusion about steps).
- Help capture **complaints or concerns** to feed into Energy Trust’s quality assurance and improvement process.
- Participate in **feedback loops** with Energy Trust so program adjustments reflect real community experience.

## 4. Desired CBO Qualifications

Respondents to the RFQ should demonstrate:

- **Community trust and embeddedness** in one or more priority communities (e.g., low-income households, communities of color, renters, multifamily tenants, rural customers, manufactured home residents).
- Experience delivering **direct services, outreach, case management, or navigation** for energy, housing, health, or related programs.
- Capacity to manage **basic data collection and privacy**, including:
  - Handling income documentation and personally identifiable information (PII) carefully.
  - Using secure tools for storing and transmitting documents.
- Ability to provide services **in multiple languages** or via strong partnerships.
- Organizational stability and a clear **staffing plan** for the HOMES/HEAR support work.

Collaborative responses (coalitions or networks) are encouraged where multiple CBOs can collectively cover different geographies or communities.
